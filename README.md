Iguana
======

Prototype parser run-time, back-end for different kinds of parser generators, including [Rascal](http://www.rascal-mpl.org).

Iguana is based on the GLL parsing algorithm, and provides scannerless parsing features.

We are currently extending it to be able to cover the disambiguation features of Rascal and to provide full unicode support as required by Rascal.
